## Update Python SPDX library to SPDX 2.1

Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) is “a set of standards for communicating the components, licenses, and copyrights associated with software”. You can find the latest (as well as the previous) standards at: https://spdx.org/specifications. The Python SPDX library does not support the latest SPDX-2.1 standard (instead, it can handle SPDX-1.2) which makes it logical to add support for the latest standard. The aim of the project is to update the python SPDX library to SPDX 2.1 specification with a better Error Management system and an improved internal model.

## Add New License Submittal Feature to Online Tools

The aim of this project is to design and develop new features to an existing SPDX web application (https://github.com/spdx/spdx-online-tools), that will allow software licenses producers to generate new license requests submissions in a more robust and user-friendly way. These new features are going to enhance the process that the SPDX legal team follows to check new license request submissions as well as to generate the new licenses XML files. These improvements will reduce the time the process of enriching the SPDX licenses list takes (https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML).

## Add a License XML Editor to the Online Tools

All the licenses of the SPDX License List are stored in the license-list-XML repository in XML format. So, creating or editing an XML license is a manual process and requires the editing of XML files by the SPDX team members. This can be challenging for the person who wants to contribute but is not familiar with XML and working with XML files can sometimes be a tedious job.

The aim of this project is to create a web-based XML editor using which anyone can create and edit the license XML files, download the newly edited XML file and can create a pull request in the license-list-XML repository to get his changes merged.
