## SBOM Conformance Checker Proposal

The minimum constituent parts of an overall Software Bill of Material (SBOM) – referred to as NTIA’s minimum elements – are three broad, interrelated areas (Data Fields, Automation Support, and Practices and Processes). These elements will enable an evolving approach to software transparency, capturing both the technology and the functional operation. The purpose of this project is to check if an SBOM document contains the minimum required data fields such as the supplier name, component name, component version, unique identifiers, dependency relationships, author of the SBOM, and timestamps.

## A Scalable, Secure and Service-Oriented Private License Management System

The project involves web-based system for managing license texts; similar to the SPDX License List but oriented towards other private collections of licenses. My proposal here is to build a scalable, secure Private license management system with a 3-tier architecture: 1) Thin front end with HTML, CSS and Java script 2) SOA(Service Oriented Architecture) based middle tier with Python based REST APIs 3) A Secure persistent data storage With SOA we plan to build a scalable software and along with the RDBMS system we ensure a reliable and secure data solution. The solution encompasses Checking if the namespaces and license format is in accordance with the SPDX License List Matching Guidelines, v2.1, Deduplication to eliminate any duplicate licenses in the system and also converting the license information uploaded to user into a Canonical format using a Mapping function and store it in the Secure database.
